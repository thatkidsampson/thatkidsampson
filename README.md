#  Hi, I'm Pete
🧪 I'm a protein science expert and Python developer.

👨‍💻 I mostly write workflows to streamline data handling, automate analyses, programme liquid handling and interact with lab notebooks.

🚀 Looking to expand on this experience and currently updating this repo with a few code examples.
