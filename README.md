#  Hi, I'm Pete
I'm a protein science expert and [Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-Python-informational?style=flat&logo=python&color=3776AB) developer.

I mostly write workflows to streamline data handling, automate analyses, programme liquid handling and interact with lab notebooks.

I'm looking to expand on this experience.
